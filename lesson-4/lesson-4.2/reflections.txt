You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* What new skills have you learned?
- There are quite a few tags and it is important to consult documentation to make sure they are being used properly or at risk of being depracated as HTML standards continue to change.

* What has been easy?
- It is much easier to create the HTML when going off a design and trying to match it, rather than trying to design while coding. 

* What has been difficult?
- Constantly checking documentation to see if the correct tag is being used, and also seeing where additional tags might be added that I wouldn't at first consider, for example <cite>. 

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
- The strategies help me to continously question, and if in doubt, look it up.
