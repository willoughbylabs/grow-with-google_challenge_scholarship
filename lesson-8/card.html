			<p>The Sciuridae family is highly varied with 285 species, including the nifty (and cute) Japanese flying squirrel <a href="https://goo.gl/4NbAJR">(Pteromys momonga)</a>. These clever animals were purposely introduced to US city parks to create <a href="https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/ladybits/squirrels-and-men-how-we-moved-squirrels-our-cities">“a bucolic atmosphere”</a>. To prevent teeth wear from gnawing on nuts, their front four continue to grow throughout their lifetime. When threatened, squirrels run away in a zigzag pattern as a strategy to escape predators, but it also leads to discombobulated drivers! </p>
